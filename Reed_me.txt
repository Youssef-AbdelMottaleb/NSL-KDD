With the dramatic growth of computer networks usage and the huge increase in the number of applications running on top of it, network security is becoming increasingly while the all the systems suffers from security vulnerabilities, which could increase the attacks that could negatively affects the economy.
Therefore detecting vulnerabilities in the system in the network has been more important and need to be done as accurate as possible in real time.
in this task a moel will be created and trained using SVM classifier to distengush if there is an attack or not in the network packet.

In this task, Intrusion Detection system will be created and designed using Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm: 

1-able to classify the if the packets is attack or normal

2-Apply all the kernels that has been mentioned in the lecture ( Gassuian, RBF, Linear, polynomial) and compare the results

3-Apply Grid-search VS Random techniques to select the parameters and compare the two results
